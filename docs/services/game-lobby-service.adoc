== Introduction

The Game Lobby Microservice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Game Lobby microservice employs the hexagonal architecture approach to maintain clear separation between its core domain logic and external dependencies.
The service is designed with various modules, adapters, and interfaces to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.
== Architecture Overview

[.architecture]

The Game Lobby microservice is structured into different modules and adapters:

* `game-lobby-app`: The main application module containing the runner class and application configuration.
* `game-lobby-domain`: Contains domain entities, business logic, and interfaces for external communication.
* `game-lobby-service-db-adapter`: Responsible for handling database interactions.
* `game-lobby-service-message-queue`: Manages interactions with the message queue.
* `game-lobby-service-rest-adapter`: Exposes REST endpoints for communication.
* `game-lobby-service-security-adapter`: Manages the microservice's security.

== Modules and Adapters

=== Game Lobby App

The `game-lobby-app` module holds the main runner class and application configuration.
It acts as the entry point to the microservice.

=== Game Lobby Domain

The `game-lobby-domain` module focuses on the core domain logic.
It defines domain entities and creates interfaces for other modules to consume.
This module encapsulates the business rules and essential functionalities.

=== Database Adapter

The `game-lobby-service-db-adapter` interacts with the database.
It handles processes such as persisting and retrieving game lobby information.

=== Message Queue Adapter

The `game-lobby-service-message-queue` module is responsible for communication with the message queue.
It facilitates the publication and consumption of messages for game start events.

=== REST Adapter

The `game-lobby-service-rest-adapter` module exposes REST endpoints for external communication.
It translates incoming HTTP requests into domain-specific actions.

=== Security Adapter

The `game-lobby-service-security-adapter` module manages the microservice's security.
It handles authorization using the configured security mechanisms.

== Interaction Flow

The hexagonal architecture encourages clear interaction between the modules.
For example, when a new game lobby is created through a REST endpoint, the flow might be:

1. An HTTP request triggers the `game-lobby-service-rest-adapter`.
2. The adapter invokes the appropriate method in the `game-lobby-domain`.
3. The domain service might validate the request, create a game lobby entity, and interact with the `game-lobby-service-db-adapter` to persist the data.
4. Upon successful persistence, a message might be published using the `game-lobby-service-message-queue` for the game engine to initiate game creation.

== Create Game Lobby

[.endpoint]
=== Create New Game Lobby

[.tag]
Operation:: POST /create
Summary:: Game lobby registration endpoint
Tags:: GameLobby

This endpoint allows players to create a new game lobby.

Security::
- Requires ROLE_PLAYER authority.

Response::
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK
- **Content-Type**: application/json

Response Body:: Game Lobby API Model (JSON)

[source,json]
----
{
  "gameLobbyId": "uuid_here"
  // Other properties
}
----

== Find Available Game Lobbies

[.endpoint]
=== Find Available Game Lobbies

[.tag]
Operation:: GET /find/available
Summary:: Find available Game lobby endpoint
Tags:: GameLobby

This endpoint allows players to find available game lobbies.

Security::
- Requires ROLE_PLAYER authority.

Response::
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK
- **Content-Type**: application/json

Response Body:: List of Game Lobby API Models (JSON)

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "gameLobbyId": "uuid_here"
    // Other properties
  }
  // More lobbies
]
----

== Join Available Game Lobby

[.endpoint]
=== Join Available Game Lobby

[.tag]
Operation:: POST /join/{id}
Summary:: Join available Game lobby endpoint
Tags:: GameLobby

This endpoint allows players to join an available game lobby.

Security::
- Requires ROLE_PLAYER authority.
- Requires Bearer Authentication.

Response::
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK
- **Content-Type**: application/json

Response Body:: Game Lobby API Model (JSON)

[source,json]
----
{
  "gameLobbyId": "uuid_here"
  // Other properties
}
----

== Game Start and RabbitMQ Integration

When a game lobby is created and starts, the Game Lobby microservice publishes a message to RabbitMQ to initiate game creation in the Game Engine microservice.

== MySQL Database

The Game Lobby microservice utilizes MySQL to store game lobby information.

== Error Responses

- **Description**: Game lobby not found
- **Content-Type**: application/json

Response Body:: Error Message (JSON)

[source,json]
----
{
  "errorMessage": "Lobby not found"
}
----

- **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
- **Description**: Game lobby action failed
- **Content-Type**: application/json

Response Body:: Error Message (JSON)

[source,json]
----
{
  "errorMessage": "Action failed"
}
----
