== Introduction

Welcome to the Microservices Documentation!
This comprehensive document provides insights into various microservices that collectively contribute to a cohesive application ecosystem.
These microservices collaborate to deliver a seamless user experience.

== Game Engine Microservice

=== Overview

The Game Engine microservice serves as the heart of the gaming experience, handling game rules, state, and logic.
It adheres to the hexagonal architecture for modularity and scalability.

=== Architecture Overview

The Game Engine microservice comprises modules and adapters such as:

* `game-engine-app`: Main runner class and application configuration.
* `game-engine-domain`: Contains domain logic and interfaces.
* `game-engine-service-db-adapter`: Handles database interactions with MongoDB for scalability.
* `game-engine-service-message-queue`: Manages message queue integration.
* `game-engine-service-rest-adapter`: Exposes REST endpoints.
* `game-engine-service-security-adapter`: Manages microservice security.

=== Interaction Flow

The `game-engine-service-rest-adapter` communicates with external sources, invoking the `game-engine-domain` to process requests.
It enforces game rules, updates game status, and interacts with the `game-engine-service-db-adapter` for data storage.
The `game-engine-service-message-queue` listens for messages from the lobby service, initiating game creation.

=== Testing Approach

The Game Engine microservice employs Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using the Cucumber framework.
Scenarios are written in Gherkin syntax and executed using Cucumber to validate features.

== Game Lobby Microservice

=== Overview

The Game Lobby microservice manages game lobbies, offering creation, availability, and joining functionalities.
It follows the hexagonal architecture for clarity and flexibility.

=== Architecture Overview

The Game Lobby microservice comprises modules and adapters including:

* `game-lobby-app`: Main runner class and application configuration.
* `game-lobby-domain`: Holds domain entities and interfaces.
* `game-lobby-service-db-adapter`: Manages database interactions using MySQL.
* `game-lobby-service-message-queue`: Handles message queue communication.
* `game-lobby-service-rest-adapter`: Exposes REST endpoints.
* `game-lobby-service-security-adapter`: Ensures microservice security.

=== Interaction Flow

The `game-lobby-service-rest-adapter` handles external requests, prompting the `game-lobby-domain` to process the requests.
It communicates with the `game-lobby-service-db-adapter` for data storage and the `game-lobby-service-message-queue` to initiate game creation.

=== Testing Approach

The Game Lobby microservice follows Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber for feature testing.
Scenarios written in Gherkin syntax are executed using Cucumber to ensure feature correctness.
